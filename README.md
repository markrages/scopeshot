# scope_shot.py

The simplest oscilloscope screenshot from Agilent MSO-X 3000 series oscilloscopes.

Getting a screenshot from the oscilloscope is a trivially easy with the [msox3000](https://pypi.org/project/msox3000/) library.

This is a script to take a screenshot and save it in the Ubuntu "Pictures" directory.

It comes with the udev script to work with my MSO-X 3014A scope.
